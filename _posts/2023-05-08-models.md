# Models

I've been following along with the fast.ai course and it's actually very interesting. 
Looking under the hood at how neural networks and models work is something I hadn't considered before.
To me, it was all just magic but seeing how all the mathematics behind it interacts and functions is pretty amazing stuff.

I'm quite glad this deep learning stuff was included in this course because it's really cool to learn about.
