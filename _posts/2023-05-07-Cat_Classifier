# AI Classifier 

I recently finished doing a fast.ai classifier for big cats! 
It was a very interesting task to see how all the parts of fast.ai interact. 
I was quite surprised at how little code and time was required to make it run effectively.
It was also very accurate model despite some interesting pieces of data. Here are some of the results!
